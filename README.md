# Regression and Clustering Analysis

This Python script demonstrates several techniques for regression analysis and clustering using popular libraries like pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, and scikit-learn. Below is a brief overview of the topics covered in the script:

## 1. Data Loading and Exploration
- The script begins by loading a dataset from a CSV file using pandas.
- It then explores the dataset by displaying the first few rows and extracting key-value pairs and column names.

## 2. Linear Regression
- Linear regression is performed using scikit-learn.
- The data is split into training and testing sets.
- The script creates and trains a linear regression model, evaluates it using cross-validation, and prints the R-squared scores.

## 3. Ridge Regression
- Ridge regression, a regularization technique, is implemented using scikit-learn.
- Grid search is used to find the optimal hyperparameters.
- The best parameters and score are printed.

## 4. Lasso Regression
- Lasso regression, another regularization technique, is implemented similarly to Ridge regression.
- Grid search is used to find the optimal hyperparameters.
- The best parameters and score are printed.

## 5. Logistic Regression
- Logistic regression is performed using scikit-learn on the breast cancer dataset.
- The script loads the dataset, prepares the features and target variables, and prints class distribution.

## 6. Decision Tree
- Decision tree classification is demonstrated using scikit-learn on the Iris dataset.
- The script loads the dataset, fits a decision tree classifier, and visualizes the decision tree.

## 7. Performance Evaluation and Clustering
- Clustering performance is evaluated using silhouette analysis.
- KMeans clustering is applied to a sample dataset.
- The script plots the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Silhouette plots are generated to visualize cluster quality.

This script provides a comprehensive overview of regression analysis and clustering techniques in Python, utilizing various libraries and tools available in the data science ecosystem.
